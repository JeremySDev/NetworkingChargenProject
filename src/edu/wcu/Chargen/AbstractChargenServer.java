/**
 * AbstractChargenServer is an abstract class that implements the ChargenServer
 * interface. This class includes attributes that are common to all Chargen
 * server implementations, as well as protected methods that enable subclasses
 * to access those attributes. For all constructors, if no
 * ChargenCharacterSource is supplied, DefactoChargenCharacterSource is used by
 * default. getCharacterSource() will return a ChargenCharacterSource â€“ an
 * object used to generated the character sequence produced by the server.
 * changeSource(ChargenCharacterSource) will accept a new ChargenCharacterSource
 * that will change the one used to generate characters.
